def make_patches(width, height, patch_size, overlap):
    """
    Create a grid of overlapping patches for an image.

    This function divides an image into a grid of overlapping patches based on the
    specified dimensions and overlap. It calculates the necessary padding and returns
    the dimensions of the padded image along with the coordinates of each patch.

    Args:
        width (int): The width of the original image.
        height (int): The height of the original image.
        patch_size (int): The size of each square patch.
        overlap (float): The fraction of overlap between adjacent patches (0.0 to 1.0).

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing three elements:
            - padded_width (int): The width of the padded image.
            - padded_height (int): The height of the padded image.
            - patch_boxes (list): A list of tuples, where each tuple contains four integers
              (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax) representing the coordinates of a patch.
